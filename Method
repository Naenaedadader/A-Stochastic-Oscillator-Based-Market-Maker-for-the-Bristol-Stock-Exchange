1. Data Source
This study uses the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) simulation environment, which replicates core market mechanisms such as the limit order book and matching engine.

Four trading datasets were used: offset-copper-10, offset-ibm-1m, offset-nasdaq-1m, and offset-tnote10yr-1m.

Each dataset was simulated 35 times, covering a 10-day trading period.

2. Design of the New Trading Algorithm

Core Algorithm: TraderMMM02:
Utilizes the Stochastic Oscillator (KD Line) to determine buy and sell decisions:

K line triggers buy actions when it falls below 25 and is lower than the D line.

The D line, a 3-period simple moving average of the K line, smoothens short-term volatility.

Simplified RSV (Raw Stochastic Value) calculation:
Uses the last 14 trading prices as the period instead of the traditional 14-day period.

Introduces a loss function:
Protects against selling at unacceptably low prices to ensure profit margins.
------------------------
3. Trading Simulation Design
Simulation Conditions:
Compare the performance of TraderMMM02 against the baseline model TraderMMM01.
Simulate different market environments, such as high and low volatility scenarios.

Trading Rules:
Apply the KD Line to identify overbought or oversold market conditions.
Use the loss function to avoid selling under unfavorable conditions.
------------------------
4. Performance Evaluation
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U Test:
Compare the profitability of MMM02 and MMM01 under various market conditions.
Test for statistical significance using P-values and R-values, with results showing MMM02 significantly outperforms MMM01.

Mean Squared Error (MSE):
Measure the average profit performance differences between MMM02 and MMM01, with significant disparities observed.
Profit Residual Distribution:
Calculate profit differences between MMM02 and MMM01 and analyze their characteristics using histograms.
----------------------------
5. Statistical and Visualization Analysis
Use statistical charts (e.g., residual distribution histograms) to visualize the performance of different algorithms.
Integrate tables and metrics (e.g., R-values, P-values, and MSE) to further confirm the advantages of MMM02.
